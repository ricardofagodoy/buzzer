# buzzer
Simple buzzer for quizzes.

This is a very basic example of an online buzzer button!

"WTF you mean?"

Well, you can create your room (being a room master) and receiving a room code (like 5467). Then, people can join your room!

"Hm... and what?"

There is a "button" which is written "Ready to push!".
The first one to press it down, will have his name written on it!

Master can reset the button by pushing it down (Ready to push! will be back).

You can use this EXTREMELY simple prototype for quizzes on a classroom for example. Get your students connected and ask some question. The name that appears on the button, is the guy who wants to answer.

The logic seems to be working, just need someone to work on the layout!
